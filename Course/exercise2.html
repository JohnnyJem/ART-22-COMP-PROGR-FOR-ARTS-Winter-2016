Art 22 Winter 2016 Programming Exercise #2
HTML/CSS/JavaScript Image Kaleidoscope

Reivew the code and Steps 1-10 in the comments below to modify this page and
create a custom image kaleidoscope. You will use functions, conditionals, variables,
operators and arrays to fade the opacity of two images over a background and
simultaneoulsy move the images to create a crude kaleidoscope effect.

<script>

//Step 3 declaring our elements

//references to our DOM image elements
var image1Background = document.getElementById("imageBackground1");
var image2Background = document.getElementById("imageBackground2");

var image1 = "resources/img1.gif";
var image2 = "resources/img2.png";
var image3 = "resources/img3.gif";
var image4 = "resources/img4.png";
var image5 = "resources/img5.png";
var image6 = "resources/img6.png";


//adding our image variables to an array
var imagePaths = [image1,image2,image3,image4,image5,image6];


//Step 3 Creating our pickRandom() function

/**
 * Changes our HTML image1 and image 2 elements to an image in our images array
 * according to a number randomly generated between 0 and the length of our images array.
 */
function pickRandom(){
    //The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
    var r1 = Math.floor((Math.random() * this.imagePaths.length));
    var r2 = Math.floor((Math.random() * this.imagePaths.length));

    //variables will be logged when function is called
    console.log(r1);
    console.log(r2);

    //Changes the image that image1 and image 2 in our DOM is referencing according
    //to random numbers generated for variables r1 and r2.
    image1Background.src = imagePaths[r1];
    image2Background.src = imagePaths[r2];
}

//Step 5 creating our global variables
var currentOpacity = 0;
var fadeSpeed = 0.01;

//Step 6
/*
Declare a function called fade that takes 0 arguments.
The fade function should do the following:
- set the opacity of image2 to currentOpacity
- increment currentOpacity by fadeSpeed (add fadeSpeed to currentOpacity)
- use a conditional:
  if currentOpacity is greater than or equal to 1 OR currentOpacity is less than or equal to 0,
  then invert fadeSpeed (multiply fadeSpeed by negative 1).
- log the value of currentOpacity to the console so you can check your results.
  the value of currentOpacity should oscillate between 0 and 1.
- Your image2 should fade in and out
- once that's working set image1's opacity to equal 1 - currentOpacity
- You should have a smooth cross fade between image1 and image2
Note: a interval timer calling the fade function every 30 ms is already declared below...
*/

//Step 6 Declaring our fade function

/**
 *Sets opacity of our DOM image1 background to currentOpacity
 *increment currentOpacity by fadeSpeed (add fadeSpeed to currentOpacity)
 */
function fade(){

    currentOpacity += fadeSpeed;
    if(currentOpacity >= 1 || currentOpacity <= 0){
        fadeSpeed = fadeSpeed * (-1);
    }

    //loggin the value of current opacity. It should oscillate between 0 and 1;
    console.log(currentOpacity);

    image1Background.style.opacity = currentOpacity;
    image2Background.style.opacity = 1 - currentOpacity;

}

//Step 7
/*
Create two global variables to hold the left or top position of image1 and image2.
For example, var image1Left, etc.
Create two more global variables called image1Speed and image2Speed.
Set the default value of image1Speed to -5 and the default value of image2Speed to 5.
*/

//Step 7

//Step 8
/*
Declare a function called move that takes 0 arguments.
In the function:
- Set the absolute left or top position of image2 to the global variable you created in Step 7.
- Increment your global position variable by image2Speed (add image2Speed to the global position variable).

Refresh the page and you should see image 2 move to the right or down and eventually off the screen.

Add a conditional to the move function so the image will reverse direction of movement when
it is halfway off the screen and then resume right or downwards movement when it is back to the left or top.
Hints:
- think about what we did in the fade function to reverse the opacity fade.
- your conditional will have to check your global position variable for 2 conditions
- window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2 will be useful
- review previous animation.html and multianimation.html examples for clues

Add similar motion and a conditional for image1, which should move in the opposite direction.
Note: We set image1Speed to the negative of image2Speed, so it will move the opposite direction by default.
Hint: You might need to compare the left or top global variable to a negative number.
*/

image1Background.style.height = window.innerHeight;
image1Background.style.width = window.innerWidth/2;

image2Background.style.height = window.innerHeight;
image2Background.style.width = window.innerWidth/2;

var currentX = 50;
var moveSpeed = 0.10;

function move(){

    //working on our images
    image2Background.style.left = currentX +"%";

    currentX += moveSpeed;

    if(currentX >= 100 || currentX <= 50){
        moveSpeed = moveSpeed * (-1);
    }

    //loggin the value of current opacity. It should oscillate between 0 and 1;
    console.log(currentX);

    //working on
    image1Background.style.right = 100 - currentX + "%";
    image2Background.style.left = 100 - currentX + "%";

}


//Step 10
//Upload your html and any necessary images to your webspace and add a link to your
//kaleidoscope to your homepage.

//Optional BONUSES
//Add rotation to the images to improve the effect.
//Add a button or HTML slider to change fadeSpeed or movement speeds

//our only setup is to start a couple timers for fade and move functions
function setup()
{
  setInterval(fade, 30);
  setInterval(move, 30);
}
//standard for most pages - causes setup() to be called when the page loads
window.onload = setup();
