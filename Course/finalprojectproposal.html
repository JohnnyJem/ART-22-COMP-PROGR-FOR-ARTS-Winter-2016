        <h2>Aesthetic Goals</h2>
        <p>Swiping left or right through "views" or "pages" of data has become standard in todays modern user interfaces.
        My artistic goal for this project involves becoming fluent with manipulating the properties(such as
        alpha X/Y/Z, scale, rotation etc...) of each page. This project will specifically focus on animating the
        elements <b>inside</b> the page.</p>
        <h2>Technical Goals</h2>
        <p>To accomplish my Aesthetic goal I will seek to become familiar in the most <b>basic</b> sense with
             Google's <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.0.2_r1/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager.java">"Viewpager"</a> implementation </p>
         to use as a model (or and other slide-show-esque web implementations). I will also have to become familiar with translating each page's elements relative
        to the visible page and the adjacent pages just off the screen.
        <h2>Sketch/Diagram</h2>
        <p>  This project will be preferably work only on mobile devices(as some examples on p5.js are seen to require mobile's to work).
            The front-end will consist of a 2 or 4 setup, each taking up the full screen. Each page will have its own elements
            that, upon swipe initiation, will be exposed to a common interface that will provide positional coordinates that encompass
            the visible and adjacent pages just off the screen. **EDIT: While typing this I discovered that there is no real notion
        of "interfaces" in Javascript as there is in Java because Javascript uses what is called <b>duck typing</b>.</p>
        <p>With the provided positional parameters I will then be able to manipulate elements inside each page according to the state of
        the current page transition("swipe") that is occuring.</p>
        <p>Each page will have common "functions" that will be tested for before being called, as will the elements on each page.
        These functions will use the current positional parameters provided when calculating their attempted transformations between
            <h2>References</h2>
        <p> My inspiration was drawn from wanting to become more adept at animating elements. Considerable inspirations is drawn
        from <a href="https://medium.com/@BashaChris/the-android-viewpager-has-become-a-fairly-popular-component-among-android-apps-its-simple-6bca403b16d4#.1wqq4xtid"> Great Animations with PageTransformer</a>
        article. I believe that the experienced gain from learning how to implement a basic skeletal version of these features using p5.js
        will be easily "translated"(get it?) to working on Android animations in my future career.</p>
